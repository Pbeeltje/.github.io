### Timekeeper
<a name="Timekeeper"></a>
This project is basically a manual clock. I made it as a tool for a boardgame where 'game-time'is seperate from 'real-time'.
It comes in handy because sometime's a minute of game-time might be cause for 20 minutes of discussion in real time, and often the opposite is the case
where hours or days pass in seconds. 

Besides tracking time, whenever anything more than 2 hours passes the program rolls two six-sides die to determine the weather.
